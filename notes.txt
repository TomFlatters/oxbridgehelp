 -- Installation

 Install npm.
 Run `npm install` in the root directory of the repository.

 Old versions of node may break installation; do not use versions of Ubuntu older than 16.04.
 Installation also requires a lot of memory - recommended > 2GB of memory.

 -- Running
 
 Run `npm start` in the root directory of the repository.

 -- Pulling

 When updating the repo, be aware that more dependencies may now be requisite; as such, the project will need `npm install` to be run before another start.
